            <h2>International flights</h2><p>
            Most major airlines fly into the international airport on Tahiti, but Air Tahiti is the only airline with regular service to Bora Bora.</p>

                                       <h2>To and from the airport</h2><p>
        The Bora Bora airport is on an uninhabited motu 15 minutes from the main island. Most hotels offer complimentary water taxi service to and from the airport.</p>

                                        <h2>Getting around</h2><p>
            
    If staying on the main island, you can rent cars, scooters and bicycles. The main road around the island is about 32 miles, well paved and flat, so cycling is very doable.</p>

            <p>If staying on one of the motus, water taxi service to and from the main island takes about 15 minutes and costs around $10 per person round trip.</p>
